Available functions:
- Create Dataset,
- Remove Dataset,
- Set Dataset to Work,
- Open Dataset to Work.

## Create a Dataset

To create a dataset you need to fill a form with the following parameters:

`Name`: name of the dataset. Use A-Z,a-z,0-9_ characters.

`NgramCount`: Maximum ngram value of your database. `Default value is 3`.

`TagField`: the tagfield name from your sample JSON document.

`InterpretedFields`: fields from your sample JSON document which contains text to analyze.

`SampleDocument`: sample JSON document to define your dataset's schema.

> Tip: use the built-in JSON validator.

![Demo Image2](img/create_dataset.png)

## Select Dataset To Work

To select a dataset to work, click on `select to work`, or double-click on it. You can check the selected dataset in the header - in the dataset selector.

## Import Document into Dataset

To import document into your dataset, select your target dataset, right-click and select Import Document from ... menu item. You can select Import Document from JSON or from CSV.
After selecting the right import format, you can select the source file using your file browser. After selecting the source file - a setting window pops-up. Here you can set the delimiter that will apply during CSV parsing. There is also a force import checkbox.
Using force mode, all the errors will be detected and reported, but the import will be continued anytime. Not using Force mode, import process will stop when the first error detected.

**CSV Import**

Import from CSV source. Built-in bulk process is automatically activated.
Reading and parsing is partial, there is no memory leak threat.

**JSON Import**

Import from JSON source. Built-in bulk process is automatically activated. Source file is loaded into memory, than during the parsing, bulk upload is available.
`Avoid memory leak`.

### Format and Fields

In the CSV or JSON template file - you should use the same field names just in your dataset template. Filed match process is automated.

> Tip: during CSV import you can set the bulk import number in the settings.
 
![Demo Image2](img/import.png)

### Import Progress Bar

When import starts a progress bar pops-up. You can see the estimated progress, the successfully imported document number and the error number occurred.

![Demo Image2](img/import_process.png)

## Import Tag into Dataset

Each dataset has a tag storage. You can easily create and manage your tags. During tag import you can use JSON or CSV format. To import tags, select the target dataset, right-click and select Import Tag from CSV or JSON.
After selecting the right import process select the source file using file browser. A setting window pops-up to select the delimiter and the force option.

**Important**

Format and field names are given. `Id, Name, Parent`.

*Sample Category CSV*

Id  |   Name    |   Parent
--- |   ---     |    ---
7   |   Animal  |   Null
9   |   Dog     |   7
10  |   Cat     |   7
11  |   Chihuahua    |   9

> Tip: organize your tags into hierarchy and use it as a category tree.

## Remove Dataset

To remove a dataset select your target dataset, right-click and select Remove. A security window pops-up, to make sure you are going to remove the right dataset. After pressing Ok, the dataset is going to be removed.

**Important**

After removing a dataset, each documents and tags will be removed.

### Sampling

Create random selection from dataset.
Available options:
- Filter by tags,
- Stratified or Normal sampling procedure,
- Fix number, or % sample size definition,
- Sample Size definition.

*Filter by tags*

You can select from which tags you would like to create your samples. For a general e-commerce sampling a typical usage is to select all the leaf level tags and use them for sampling.

*Sampling procedure*

You can use normal sampling, using your fill dataset-part as the whole dataset, then using a statistically random selection process.
Using Stratified method, sampling will be created tag by tag, using the same size declaration process.

> Tip: for general e-commerce sampling use normal sampling procedure.

*Sampling Size Definition*

You can define your sample size in pre-defined number or %. Using a fix number such as 10000, your sample size will be 10 000. Using a 10% relative sample size in the case of have a dataset with 1 million documents, the sample size will be 100 000.

![Demo Image2](img/sampling.png)

For tag filtering use our built-in tag selector:

![Demo Image2](img/sampling_category_selector.png)

*Example Filter Result - using fix size (3), non-stratified sample from each categories:*

### Filter

Use filter for complex search processes.

With Filter you can:
- Filter by tags,
- Filter by any fields,
- Use Logical Expression,
- Use Wildcards,
- Use multiple queries with hierarchy.

*Filter uses built-in search engine with powerful and fast search capabilities.*

> Tip: build powerful, real-time search function using Filter.

# Services

Using Slamby you can freely create data processing services. Each service has a dedicated API endpoint that you can use for data processing.
Each service has custom settings availability to create a customized processor.

Service creation steps:
1. Create Empty Service,
2. Provide custom setting and start training/preparation,
3. Provide custom activation settings,
4. Activate service.

No. |   Stage   |   Description
--- |   ---     |   ---
1.  |   Create Empty Service    |   To create a service, the first step is to create an empty service. During this process you can select the type of the service, provide the name and description of it. When the service is ready, the service unique ID already exists. After creation is done the service status is `New`
2.  |   Preparation |   The next step is to prepare the service. During this process you can set your custom settings generally about the training process. When preparation starts, service status will be changed to `Busy`. When the preparation finishes, the status will be changed to `Prepared`
3.  |   Activation  |   Prepared services can be activated. When a service is prepared it means the training and setting process is ready, the service is ready to use, all the required files are ready to use. Without activation you cannot use the service. Before activation you can set your custom settings about the API endpoint to customize your data processing. During activation Slamby server reads the service and related files, opening an available API endpoint, loading the service into memory and become ready to serve your requests. When the service is activated, the status will be changed to `Activated`. 
4.  |   Test a Service  |   You can test your activated service by clicking on the recommend button. A test window pops-up with the available service details as a JSON document. You can fill it out and send your request to the service API endpoint. After sending your request you can see the response.
